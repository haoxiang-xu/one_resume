# **Resume Score:** `8.5`

**Comment:** The applicant demonstrates outstanding technical proficiency across nearly all required domains, including deep expertise in data warehousing, BI architecture, Microsoft Azure technologies, and data modeling/design tools (Erwin, Visio). The educational background is a strong match with a BSc in Computer Science and current Master of Data Science studies. Project and work experience evidence advanced analytical, technical, and communication skills, with solid leadership activities. However, the application lacks the minimum 7+ years of progressive experience in a Data Solution Architect (or similar) role—most experience is within the last 1-2 years and includes internships and academic projects rather than extended professional tenures. There are no industry certifications (Azure or otherwise), and only indirect evidence of coaching/mentoring teams.

**Feedback:** To improve fit for senior architect roles, gain several more years of hands-on, client-facing experience in enterprise environments and pursue industry-recognized certifications (such as Microsoft Azure or data architecture). Highlight direct coaching or mentoring of teams on architectural best practices in future roles.
