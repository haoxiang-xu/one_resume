# **Resume Score:** `8.5`

**Comment:** The applicant demonstrates outstanding alignment with nearly all technical and architectural requirements for the Data Solution Architect role, including deep expertise in Microsoft Azure, data warehousing, BI, analytics architecture, and relevant modeling tools (Erwin, Visio). The resume also shows strong leadership and mentoring abilities, stakeholder collaboration, and Agile experience, fulfilling the majority of key responsibilities. However, there is a significant shortfall regarding the required 7+ years of progressive experience in a client-facing Data Solution Architect role—the documented experience falls below 2 years. The lack of Azure or industry-recognized certifications is another minor gap.

**Feedback:** To improve fit for senior architect roles, gain additional years of hands-on, client-facing data solution architecture experience and obtain relevant Azure or industry certifications. Consider strengthening your resume with longer-term or additional roles to clearly meet the 7+ years requirement.

### Qualifications

- **Qualification**: Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Information Systems or related field
  - **Score**: `10`
  - **Comment**: The resume states: 'Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at University of British Columbia, Canada (Sep 2020 – Nov 2023) - GPA: 3.9/4.0'. This exactly matches the requirement of a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or related field.

- **Qualification**: 7+ years of progressive experience in a client-facing Data Solution Architect role
  - **Score**: `3`
  - **Comment**: The resume shows strong, relevant experience as a Data Solution Architect, but the documented timeframe does not meet the 7+ years requirement. The two architect roles listed span roughly Apr 2023 – Sep 2023 and Mar 2024 – Aug 2024, totaling less than two years. While the candidate demonstrates excellent alignment with the responsibilities, the duration falls significantly short. No other past roles are stated to fill in the experience gap.

- **Qualification**: Experience in IT services
  - **Score**: `7`
  - **Comment**: There is significant and clear experience in IT services. The candidate worked as a Data & AI Solution Architect at Shanghai Mengou Technology and University of British Columbia, implementing data platforms, architecting solutions, and deploying scalable IT systems for clients and internal stakeholders. These are classic IT services activities, implying strong experience. However, the phrase 'IT services' is not literally used, so a small deduction is made.

### Nice_to_haves

- **Qualification**: Azure certification, Industry recognized certifications
  - **Score**: `2`
  - **Comment**: The resume lists extensive Azure skills (Microsoft Azure, Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Data Factory) under 'Skills', indicating practical familiarity, but there is no direct mention of any Azure certification or other industry recognized certifications. The only credentials listed are academic degrees. Therefore, there is at most weak evidence for certifications, with a possibility that expertise could lead to certification, but none is stated.
