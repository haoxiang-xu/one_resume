In addition, I build and maintain automated testing and continuous delivery pipelines with tools such as Jenkins, Git, SonarQube, and Kubernetes (k8s), which improve code quality, deployment efficiency, and system stability. \n",

    "At Shanghai Mengou Technology Co., Ltd, a fast-paced AI startup serving retail clients, I worked as a hybrid Full Stack Developer and Machine Learning Engineer, leading the design and deployment of a production-grade AI agent system for automated customer service. The system utilized large language models (LLMs) to handle complex retail inquiries—from complaints and product Q&A to personalized purchase assistance—by dynamically interpreting client-specific product databases. My responsibilities spanned across the full stack, including developing RESTful APIs using FastAPI and Python, implementing scalable backend logic, and building responsive frontend components for internal tooling using React. On the AI side, I fine-tuned transformer-based LLMs for domain adaptation and performed extensive prompt engineering to guide the models toward accurate, grounded responses.\n",
    "A significant challenge we tackled was the hallucination problem, especially in quoting prices and inventory availability. To mitigate this, I designed a multi-agent verification framework using a layered retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, incorporating vector search via FAISS and context-aware checks with agentic self-reflection loops inspired by LangChain. This reduced pricing inconsistencies by over 60% and helped avoid potential legal disputes arising from false quotes.\n",
    "I also developed an internal logging and analytics dashboard that tracked model responses, API latencies, and error rates—allowing our team to continuously monitor system performance and customer behavior. Through this, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and built lightweight anomaly detection scripts to flag outlier responses. My work aligned closely with both machine learning and data science roles, involving data cleaning, embedding analysis, and evaluation metric design. This role allowed me to grow across multiple domains, combining backend scalability, NLP model reliability, and data-driven iteration in a real-world production environment.\n",

    "As the Lead Full Stack Developer and Project Manager for a UBC Master’s Capstone project, I spearheaded the design and successful delivery of a curriculum change tracking system for the UBC Okanagan Office of the Provost. This dashboard-oriented web application automates the process of comparing academic program updates—such as course structures and credit requirements—across multiple years of raw HTML-based UBC Academic Calendars. I led a cross-functional team through the full SDLC, selecting the technology stack (React.js, Flask, MongoDB), setting milestones, and managing rapid iterations under an aggressive two-month delivery timeline. I personally designed the modular frontend architecture, implemented the backend logic and API endpoints, and handled containerization and deployment using Docker to an Ubuntu server.\n",
    "A core innovation of this project was the use of LLMs and prompt engineering to extract and align unstructured academic data across different calendar editions. I integrated OpenAI APIs to enable semi-automated change detection, which significantly reduced the manual workload and eliminated inconsistencies from prior manual tracking.\n",
    "Due to tight time constraints, I architected the project such that each module—data scraping, NLP comparison, and frontend visualization—could progress independently, minimizing interdependencies and enabling parallel development. I also maintained regular stakeholder communication, ensuring evolving client requirements were translated into actionable development goals. The resulting system provides a scalable and maintainable solution for academic quality assurance and external reporting needs.\n",

    "As a Research Assistant at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, I led an independent deep learning project focused on the automated classification of lung tumor types in CT scans. Using Python and PyTorch, I reimplemented and compared three CNN architectures—LeNet, AlexNet, and ResNet—to evaluate their effectiveness in learning efficiency and classification accuracy. The final ResNet-based model achieved over 96% accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional architectures and setting a new benchmark for the research group.\n",
    "One of the primary challenges was overcoming the vanishing gradient problem in deeper CNNs, which previously caused stagnation in model training and hindered convergence. To address this, I applied advanced normalization techniques and residual connections inspired by ResNet, which helped stabilize gradient flow and accelerate learning. Another major difficulty was managing the limited volume and variability of labeled medical imaging data, which I mitigated by implementing aggressive data augmentation strategies and transfer learning techniques to improve generalization.\n",
    "As the sole contributor, I handled every stage of the research lifecycle—from problem formulation and literature review to model design, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and final delivery. I also authored the paper that resulted from this project, which was later accepted and published in IEEE. The project is open-source and available on GitHub, and continues to be referenced in medical imaging communities and academic circles for its comparative analysis of CNN architectures in clinical diagnosis settings.\n",

    "I designed and implemented a normalized relational database using MySQL with over 20 interlinked tables, hosted on AWS RDS, to support complex data relationships such as submission states, grading rubrics, and feedback histories. On the application layer, I built a modular RESTful API with Express.js in a fully structured MVC architecture, covering user authentication, role-based access control, file uploads, grading workflows, comment threads, and instructor overrides.\n",
    "A key technical challenge was ensuring performance and maintainability at scale, especially with multiple students interacting with the system simultaneously. To address this, I implemented backend caching strategies and optimized SQL queries for batch operations. I also handled the full containerization of the backend using Docker and deployed the system using NGINX as a reverse proxy on AWS EC2 instances for secure and scalable delivery. The system underwent several rounds of live testing with actual student users and received positive feedback from faculty members on its usability and robustness.\n",
