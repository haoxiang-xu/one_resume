# **Resume Score:** `8.5`

**Comment:** The applicant demonstrates strong alignment with nearly all core requirements for the Maps Evaluator/Data Analyst position. The resume shows robust research skills, an analytical mindset, demonstrated mapping and geospatial data experience, knowledge of Canadian geography, and the ability to learn and work independently, often in remote/flexible environments. However, there are minor gaps: explicit consecutive 5-year Canadian residency is inferred but not confirmed, there is no mention of familiarity with social media platforms, and the applicant does not state explicit willingness or availability for the required work hours.

**Feedback:** To improve fit, clearly state willingness to work 10-20 hours per week and continuous Canadian residency for 5+ years. If possible, mention any experience or familiarity with social media platforms.

## Qualification Match Report

### Skills

- **Qualification**: research skills
  - **Score**: `10`
  - **Comment**: The resume directly references strong research skills multiple times: 'Detail-oriented analyst with strong research skills... in both academic and industry settings' and 'Utilized strong analytical and research skills...'. The candidate has worked as a Research Assistant at MIT and as a Data Analyst where research was a core task.

- **Qualification**: analytical mindset
  - **Score**: `10`
  - **Comment**: Analytical skills are substantiated: 'Detail-oriented analyst,' and roles involving 'data validation, process automation, and information verification' as well as 'analytical and research skills to audit, compare, and ensure correctness of structured and unstructured data.' Multiple mentions in both experiences and skill section.

- **Qualification**: local knowledge of home country (Canada)
  - **Score**: `10`
  - **Comment**: Resume provides direct evidence of local knowledge: completed both Bachelor and Master's degrees at the University of British Columbia, states 'Familiar with Canadian geography' in summary, and worked on location-based data at UBC in Canada ('Data Analyst | Maps Evaluator' at UBC).

- **Qualification**: understanding of geography and culture of Canada
  - **Score**: `9`
  - **Comment**: Strong match: Resume states 'Familiar with Canadian geography,' and experience as 'Maps Evaluator' at UBC, handling 'geographic and institutional data.' While specific evidence of cultural understanding is not stated, education and work history in Canada supports strong inference.

- **Qualification**: working knowledge of search engines
  - **Score**: `6`
  - **Comment**: Indirect but plausible relevance: No explicit mention of search engines, but has experience sourcing data and using 'advanced search tools' for research at MIT. Also skilled in data validation and information sourcing, implying practical search abilities.

- **Qualification**: familiarity with map applications
  - **Score**: `9`
  - **Comment**: Very strong match: Experience as 'Maps Evaluator' and skills in 'Mapping Data Review' and 'Geospatial Data Validation.' The resume specifies work with mapping and handling geographic information.

- **Qualification**: familiarity with social media platforms
  - **Score**: `2`
  - **Comment**: Minimal to no direct evidence: The resume does not mention social media platforms at all. However, as a recent graduate in computer science and data science, there's a slight possibility of familiarity, but no direct support is presented.

- **Qualification**: ability to learn and apply instructions independently
  - **Score**: `10`
  - **Comment**: Strong, concrete evidence: Repeated references such as 'adept at independently learning and applying complex instructions', and descriptions of remote and self-guided research at MIT. All roles require applying complex tasks independently.

### Qualifications

- **Qualification**: Fluent in English
  - **Score**: `8`
  - **Comment**: The resume is written entirely in fluent English, and the candidate completed both undergraduate and graduate studies at the University of British Columbia, Canada, where courses are delivered in English. There is no direct statement of language proficiency, but the academic and work history in English-speaking environments strongly support fluency.

- **Qualification**: Must be living in Canada for a minimum of 5 consecutive years
  - **Score**: `4`
  - **Comment**: The candidate attended UBC in Canada from Sep 2020 to Jun 2025, giving a timespan of approximately 5 years. However, uninterrupted consecutive residency is not explicitly confirmed, and there's an internship with MIT (remote) from Apr 2022 to Sep 2022. While remote work does not imply absence from Canada, explicit continuous residency is not stated.

- **Qualification**: Must pass an online open-book exam
  - **Score**: `0`
  - **Comment**: There is no evidence in the resume confirming the ability or history of passing an online open-book exam. This requirement is not addressed.

- **Qualification**: Willing to work 10-20 hours per week
  - **Score**: `0`
  - **Comment**: The candidate does not state availability or willingness to work 10-20 hours per week. There is no mention of work schedule preference or availability.

- **Qualification**: Ability to work independently
  - **Score**: `10`
  - **Comment**: Multiple roles, including 'Research Assistant' at MIT and 'Data Analyst | Maps Evaluator,' emphasize conducting research and applying complex instructions independently. Phrases such as 'Conducted independent data validation and research' and 'applying complex instructions independently throughout the research lifecycle' provide strong direct evidence.

### Nice_to_haves

- **Qualification**: Flexible schedule, Work from home/remote experience
  - **Score**: `9`
  - **Comment**: There is strong evidence of remote work experience: the candidate served as a Research Assistant at MIT (Apr 2022 – Sep 2022) in a 'Remote, US' capacity. The resume specifically states: 'Delivered high-quality results in a remote setting, consistently maintaining documentation and accuracy in both technical and research deliverables.' While there is no explicitly stated mention of 'flexible schedule,' the independent research and remote engagement strongly imply adaptability and self-management, which often require flexible scheduling; however, because 'flexible schedule' is not directly claimed, a score of 9, not 10, is assigned.
