# **Resume Score:** `8.0`

**Comment:** The applicant demonstrates very strong technical skills and direct experience with GenAI, LLMs, agentic frameworks, API/cloud integration, and solution architecture. They show full-cycle ownership in building GenAI and agentic AI systems and have relevant academic credentials (BSc completed, MSc nearly finished). However, the candidate does not meet the minimum 3+ years of professional AI engineering experience, with roughly one year documented in work history, although academic, internship, and capstone project work does reflect significant hands-on exposure. There is also no explicit confirmation of eligibility for security clearance and no industry certifications or leading conference presentations. Overall, the candidate is a strong technical fit, particularly for junior to mid-level roles, and is nearly a match for this consultant position aside from the professional experience gap.

**Feedback:** To improve fit, explicitly accumulate and document at least 3 years of professional AI engineering experience—continuing work in industry, internships, or research roles—and consider obtaining certifications in cloud AI platforms (Azure, GCP, AWS, Databricks). Additionally, if possible, outline eligibility for security clearances in applications to Canadian employers.

  - **Score**: `9`
  - **Comment**: 'LLMOps (Monitoring, Versioning)' is listed as a skill. The experience details custom monitoring, real-time performance tracking, anomaly detection, and versioning for LLM-powered products.

- **Qualification**: Solution architecture
  - **Score**: `10`
  - **Comment**: The candidate's title in two roles includes 'AI Solution Architect' and responsibilities state 'architecting a multi-agent retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline' and translating business requirements into AI architectures.

- **Qualification**: Prototyping GenAI solutions
  - **Score**: `10`
  - **Comment**: Prototyping is referenced both in the summary and experience: 'rapid prototyping and iteration', 'deploying GenAI solutions', and experience in dynamic, client-focused environments.

### Qualifications

- **Qualification**: University degree
  - **Score**: `10`
  - **Comment**: The candidate has a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (completed Nov 2023) and is currently pursuing a Master of Data Science (Sep 2024 – Jun 2025), both from the University of British Columbia. This fully satisfies the requirement.

- **Qualification**: 3+ years of AI engineering experience (development and deployment of Deep Learning, Generative AI, and Agentic AI applications)
  - **Score**: `7`
  - **Comment**: The candidate has relevant AI experience from Nov 2023 to Aug 2024, comprising an internship and a consulting role (~10 months), plus a Master's capstone project (May–Jun 2025). The resume demonstrates advanced hands-on work with Generative AI, agentic LLM systems, and deep learning (mentioning CNNs, Transformers, PyTorch). However, the documented experience falls short of 3+ years: the timeline of explicitly AI engineering positions covers less than 1 year, with some plausible experience in academic and project work likely prior, but not explicitly described as professional AI engineering. Strong but insufficient match.

- **Qualification**: Proficiency in English
  - **Score**: `9`
  - **Comment**: The candidate completed both a Bachelor and is pursuing a Master's degree at the University of British Columbia in Canada, and led a capstone project for the UBC Provost's Office. Experience collaborating with academic and business stakeholders in Canada strongly demonstrates English proficiency.

- **Qualification**: Eligibility to obtain Security Reliability clearance
  - **Score**: `4`
  - **Comment**: The resume does not directly address security clearance eligibility (e.g., citizenship, legal status, etc). However, as the candidate studied and worked in Canada, there is a weakly implied possibility of meeting eligibility, but this is not clear or explicit.

### Nice_to_haves

- **Qualification**: Master’s degree in computer science or a related technical field
  - **Score**: `9`
  - **Comment**: The candidate has a Master of Data Science from the University of British Columbia (Sep 2024 – Jun 2025, Grade: A), which is a related technical field. The only slight deduction is that the degree is in progress, but the end date is approaching, so it's nearly complete.

- **Qualification**: Experience with client-facing projects and business development proposals in consulting or agency environments
  - **Score**: `8`
  - **Comment**: The resume shows multiple client-facing consulting experiences: as an AI Engineering Consultant at a startup ('collaborated cross-functionally with product, engineering, and business teams'), as a Lead Full Stack Developer for a client-facing project for UBC's Provost Office, and as an Intern AI Consultant where they 'partnered with client stakeholders' and supported 'business development efforts through tailored solution recommendations.' Strong evidence throughout, though specifics about proposal creation are lightly inferred.

- **Qualification**: End-to-end experience enabling Gen AI applications or agentic systems, from conception to launch
  - **Score**: `10`
  - **Comment**: The candidate has 'hands-on experience building and deploying GenAI solutions, including an agentic LLM-powered customer service system and multi-agent RAG pipelines.' At Shanghai Mengou Technology, they 'led the end-to-end design, development, and deployment of a production-grade agentic AI system.' Multiple resume entries endorse conception-to-launch responsibility.

- **Qualification**: Strong communication skills, including translating complex topics to senior leadership
  - **Score**: `8`
  - **Comment**: The resume uses phrases like 'adept at translating business needs into actionable AI architectures' and mentions collaborating 'cross-functionally' and 'translating evolving client requirements into actionable deliverables.' While it doesn't explicitly cite senior leadership, the evidence points to strong and frequent communication with business stakeholders.

- **Qualification**: Presentation experience at leading industry conferences and publications (customer analytics, data, AI)
  - **Score**: `1`
  - **Comment**: No specific mention of presenting at leading industry conferences or publications. Communication skills and some stakeholder presentations are implied, but there is no evidence of conference or publication experience.

- **Qualification**: Knowledge of Responsible AI principles and implementing guardrails, content filters, fallback strategies
  - **Score**: `6`
  - **Comment**: The 'Skills' section lists 'Responsible AI Principles', and the experience section describes implementing monitoring, anomaly detection, and agentic self-reflection loops, which plausibly encompass guardrail/fallback strategies. No detailed mention of content filters or explicit guardrails, but fair evidence of general awareness and partial practical application.

- **Qualification**: Certifications related to data and Gen AI services on Azure, GCP, AWS, Databricks, Adobe, Salesforce
  - **Score**: `1`
  - **Comment**: While the 'Skills' section lists Azure, GCP, Databricks, and AWS experience, there are no certifications mentioned anywhere in the resume.
