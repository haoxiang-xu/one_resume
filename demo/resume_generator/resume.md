## Summary
Innovative machine learning engineer with hands-on experience designing and deploying production-ready Generative AI solutions using transformer-based LLMs, prompt engineering, and retrieval-augmented generation. Skilled in Python, PyTorch, RESTful APIs, and scalable data pipelines. Proficient with relational databases (MySQL), containerization (Docker), and multi-agent model verification frameworks. Strong track record in cross-functional collaboration, backend architecture, and driving operational efficiency with AI.

## Education
- **Master of Data Science** at University of British Columbia, Canada (Sep 2024 – Jun 2025) - Grade: A
- **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** at University of British Columbia, Canada (Sep 2020 – Nov 2023) - GPA: 3.9/4.0

## Experience
- **Staff Data Scientist | Generative AI Engineer** at Shanghai Mengou Technology Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China (Mar 2024 – Aug 2024)
  - Designed and deployed production-grade AI agent systems utilizing state-of-the-art transformer-based large language models to automate complex retail customer service workflows, significantly improving operational efficiency.
  - Fine-tuned LLMs via prompt engineering and domain adaptation, reducing response hallucination rates by over 60% using a custom multi-agent verification framework built with vector search (FAISS) and RAG pipelines.
  - Developed scalable data ingestion and monitoring pipelines in Python (FastAPI), leveraging logging analytics and EDA for continuous model evaluation and deployment; implemented internal dashboards for response/error tracking.
  - Collaborated cross-functionally to align backend scalability, NLP model reliability, and DevOps practices (Docker, REST APIs) for robust AI solution delivery in a fast-paced production environment.

- **Lead Full Stack & AI Solutions Developer** at University of British Columbia (Master's Capstone Project), Canada (May 2025 – Jun 2025)
  - Spearheaded AI-driven automation for large-scale curriculum change tracking using OpenAI LLMs and custom prompt engineering, dramatically reducing manual workload and increasing the consistency of academic record updates.
  - Orchestrated the full SDLC and cross-functional teamwork, architecting modular backend (Flask), frontend (React), and data integration components for scalable, maintainable deployment in a regulated university environment.
  - Containerized and deployed solutions with Docker, implemented relational database access (MongoDB), and maintained continuous feedback cycles with stakeholders to ensure system robustness and business alignment.
  - Pioneered NLP-based features for unstructured data extraction and semi-automated change detection, turning complex manual processes into reliable, AI-powered data workflows.
