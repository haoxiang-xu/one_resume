## Summary
Machine Learning Engineer skilled in designing and deploying production-grade ML and AI systems, with expertise in LLMs, prompt engineering, MLOps, RESTful APIs (FastAPI), and scalable backend architecture. Proven track record optimizing model reliability with RAG pipelines, anomaly detection, and data-driven iteration. Experienced in end-to-end workflow ownership, cross-functional collaboration, and integrating AI features into real-world products.

## Education
- **Master of Data Science** at University of British Columbia, Canada (Sep 2024 – Jun 2025) - Grade: A
- **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** at University of British Columbia, Canada (Sep 2020 – Nov 2023) - GPA: 3.9/4.0

## Experience
- **Machine Learning Engineer | AI Solutions Developer** at Shanghai Mengou Technology Co., Ltd (Startup Environment), Shanghai, China (Mar 2024 – Aug 2024)
  - Led end-to-end development and deployment of a production-grade LLM-powered customer service system, handling data ingestion, model fine-tuning, REST API integration (FastAPI, Python), and user-facing internal tooling.
  - Engineered a layered retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflow using FAISS vector search and multi-agent verification, reducing pricing errors by 60% and improving model reliability in real-time deployments.
  - Implemented automated monitoring dashboards and logging systems to track model performance, API latency, and customer behavior; used EDA and anomaly detection to iterate on model quality and operational metrics.
  - Collaborated closely with cross-functional teams to align AI solutions with business goals, continuously optimizing model inference speed and cost for scalable production use.

- **Lead Full Stack & ML Engineer** at University of British Columbia (Master's Capstone Project), Canada (May 2025 – Jun 2025)
  - Architected and delivered an automated curriculum tracking platform integrating OpenAI LLMs, enabling accurate extraction and comparison of unstructured academic data across years.
  - Designed and implemented modular data pipelines and model-serving APIs (React.js, Flask, MongoDB, Docker), accelerating feature delivery and supporting scalable online inference.
  - Directed project delivery with agile methodologies and frequent stakeholder collaboration, ensuring alignment of technical development with evolving business requirements.
  - Established reproducible workflows covering prompt engineering, pipeline testing, and project CI/CD, delivering a maintainable, high-impact ML-driven product under tight deadlines.
