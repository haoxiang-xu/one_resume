## Summary
Innovative software engineer with hands-on experience in designing and deploying scalable, distributed systems, RESTful APIs, and full stack solutions in both startup and academic environments. Proven skills in Python, JavaScript, SQL, backend architecture, LLM/NLP integration, anomaly detection, and cloud deployment (AWS, Docker). Excels at tackling ambiguity, leading cross-functional teams, and delivering high-impact, production-grade technology.

## Education
- **Master of Data Science** at University of British Columbia, Canada (Sep 2024 – Jun 2025) - Grade: A
- **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** at University of British Columbia, Canada (Sep 2020 – Nov 2023) - GPA: 3.9/4.0

## Experience
- **Software Development Engineer | Backend Systems Engineer** at University of British Columbia (Bachelor's Capstone Project), Canada (Apr 2023 – Sep 2023)
  - Designed and implemented a scalable, fault-tolerant backend architecture for a university-wide peer evaluation platform serving hundreds of concurrent users across multiple departments.
  - Led the development of RESTful APIs and relational database modeling in MySQL (hosted on AWS RDS), ensuring robust support for complex workflow automation, grading, and feedback histories.
  - Optimized system performance through backend caching, efficient SQL queries, and Docker containerization, enabling secure deployment on AWS EC2 with NGINX reverse proxy.
  - Successfully delivered a production-ready system with live user testing and positive feedback from faculty, demonstrating strong cloud deployment skills and impact-driven development.

- **Full Stack Engineer | Machine Learning Engineer** at Shanghai Mengou Technology Co., Ltd (Startup Environment), Shanghai, China (Mar 2024 – Aug 2024)
  - Led the design, development, and deployment of a production-grade AI agent system using FastAPI, Python, React, and transformer-based LLMs for scalable, automated customer service in retail.
  - Architected distributed backend logic and an innovative multi-agent RAG pipeline leveraging FAISS and LangChain concepts, reducing incorrect AI-generated pricing by over 60%.
  - Built monitoring dashboards and implemented anomaly detection to track and maintain high system performance and reliability in a live, rapidly iterating startup environment.
  - Collaborated across functional teams to ensure rapid feature delivery, efficient resource management, and alignment with real-world business impact.

- **Research Assistant** at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Remote, US (Apr 2022 – Sep 2022)
  - Designed and implemented deep learning solutions in Python and PyTorch for automated classification of lung tumors, achieving over 96% accuracy with resilient CNN architectures.
  - Solved core challenges in model convergence and data variability by introducing advanced normalization, residual connections, and data augmentation for reliable large-scale inference.
  - Managed the entire research lifecycle—from algorithm design to evaluation and publication—demonstrating self-motivation and a strong foundation in object-oriented and algorithmic principles.
  - Published findings in IEEE and open-sourced the project, contributing to ongoing research and adoption in academic and clinical domains.
