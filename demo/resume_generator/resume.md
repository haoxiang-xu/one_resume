## Summary
Machine Learning Engineer with hands-on experience designing and deploying production AI agent systems utilizing LLMs, prompt engineering, and RAG pipelines. Proficient in Python, RESTful APIs, AWS (EC2, RDS), and backend system architecture, with proven strengths in model fine-tuning, scalable API development, and full SDLC. Adept at collaborating across teams, automating workflows, and enhancing ML model reliability in fast-paced, client-driven environments.

## Education
- **Master of Data Science** at University of British Columbia, Canada (Sep 2024 – Jun 2025) - Grade: A
- **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** at University of British Columbia, Canada (Sep 2020 – Nov 2023) - GPA: 3.9/4.0

## Experience
- **Machine Learning & MLOps Engineer | Lead Backend Engineer** at Shanghai Mengou Technology Co., Ltd (Startup Environment), Shanghai, China (Mar 2024 – Aug 2024)
  - Led the end-to-end design and deployment of a production-grade AI agent platform using large language models (LLMs) to automate customer service workflows for retail clients.
  - Engineered and fine-tuned transformer-based LLMs (Python, PyTorch), implementing optimization and validation pipelines to mitigate hallucinations and improve response reliability, reducing pricing inconsistencies by 60%.
  - Developed robust RESTful APIs with FastAPI, architected modular backend logic, and integrated scalable vector-search (FAISS) with agentic self-reflection (LangChain-inspired), ensuring effective MLOps for continuous improvement.
  - Built comprehensive logging and monitoring dashboards, conducted data analysis for anomaly detection, and supported model and API deployments on AWS EC2/S3, significantly enhancing resilience and operational transparency.

- **Lead Backend Developer** at University of British Columbia (Bachelor's Capstone Project), Canada (Apr 2023 – Sep 2023)
  - Architected and delivered a university-scale peer evaluation system, serving hundreds of students, with high-performance backend services built in Node.js (Express) and MySQL on AWS RDS.
  - Implemented CI/CD automation, containerization (Docker), and secure deployment to AWS EC2, integrating NGINX for scalable and reliable production delivery.
  - Optimized database access patterns and backend workflows for scalability and fair, consistent system behavior under high concurrent load.
  - Collaborated cross-functionally with frontend and devops teams, formalizing development processes and enforcing best practices for maintainable codebases.
