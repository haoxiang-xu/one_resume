## Education
- **Master of Data Science** at University of British Columbia, Canada (Sep 2024 – Jun 2025) - Grade: A
- **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** at University of British Columbia, Canada (Sep 2020 – Nov 2023) - GPA: 3.9/4.0

## Experience
- **Machine Learning Engineer | Research Engineer, AI & Data Systems** at Shanghai Mengou Technology Co., Ltd (Startup Environment), Shanghai, China (Mar 2024 – Aug 2024)
  - Led engineering of a scalable AI-driven customer service system, aggregating multimodal data (text, code, metadata) into unified formats for large language model (LLM) training.
  - Developed and deployed robust Python data pipelines with FAISS and FastAPI to support dataset ingestion, embedding analysis, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for production ML workflows.
  - Applied rigorous data cleaning, anomaly detection, and EDA to benchmark and maintain high-quality datasets; designed experiments reducing pricing inconsistency rates by 60%.
  - Collaborated cross-functionally with engineers and stakeholders to align product features, model performance metrics, and compliance with data privacy standards.

- **Lead Full Stack & AI Developer** at University of British Columbia (Master's Capstone Project), Canada (May 2025 – Jun 2025)
  - Owned end-to-end engineering of a system to curate and align large unstructured academic datasets (HTML, text, metadata) into machine learning-ready formats.
  - Integrated LLMs and prompt engineering for automated extraction and semantic comparison, streamlining pipeline for semi-automated data processing.
  - Designed modular architecture enabling scalable parallel data ingestion and benchmarking; deployed the solution using Docker on Linux servers for maintainability.
  - Ensured detailed documentation and agile stakeholder communication, optimizing system usability and compliance with institutional policies.

- **Cloud Platform & ML Automation Developer** at SAP, Vancouver, Canada (Sep 2025 – Current)
  - Enhanced SAP’s translation platform by developing automated, scalable data pipelines and integrating large language model (LLM) solutions for workflow optimization.
  - Implemented and maintained CI/CD pipelines (using Jenkins, Git, Kubernetes) to ensure reliable deployment, system stability, and comprehensive code testing.
  - Worked in a globally distributed team, contributing robust, testable, and well-documented code that improved localization coverage for 40+ languages.
  - Explored AI-driven automation for data curation and quality assurance, collaborating with product and legal teams to ensure compliance and ethical data usage.


## Skills
- **Programming Languages & Frameworks**: Python (including PyTorch and TensorFlow for ML, Flask and FastAPI for APIs), Java (enterprise backend, core services), JavaScript (with React.js and ES6+), SQL (MySQL, database querying, data modeling)
- **Machine Learning & Data Science**: Deep Learning (CNNs, Transformers, model training, fine-tuning, evaluation metrics), Data Acquisition & Curation (multimodal/3D data, data ingestion pipelines, EDA, preprocessing), Large Language Models (LLMs, prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation RAG, embedding analysis), Benchmarking & Experimentation (A/B testing, result visualization, statistical analysis)
- **Cloud, DevOps & Deployment**: Docker (containerization, deployment, orchestration), Kubernetes (k8s, scaling microservices), AWS Cloud Platform (EC2, RDS, scalable deployment, cloud storage), CI/CD & Version Control (Git, Jenkins, automated testing, pipeline design)
- **3D & Computational Geometry**: 3D Data Processing (meshes, BReps, voxel/implicit representations), Computational Geometry (geometry algorithms, CAD data, point clouds), Multimodal Data (integrating text, images, 3D models, code, metadata), Visualization & Annotation (automated labeling, analysis dashboards, interactive tools)
